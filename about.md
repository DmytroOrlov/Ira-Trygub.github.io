Hi, my name is Iryna Trygub, and I am a junior specialist in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. I am currently studying Applied Computer Science at HAW Hamburg and am looking forward to getting my first experience in real production projects. On this page, you can get acquainted with my educational projects. I have a strong background in computer graphics and my academic journey has proven to be one of my best decisions in recent years. I am particularly proud of a student project in Computer Vision that led to a scientific publication, which received the Best Poster/Demo Paper Award at the Petra 2023 conference. Additionally, I have gained significant expertise in algorithm development through my work at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Applied Materials Research, focusing on 6D positioning of objects using neural networks. I am excited about the possibility of starting my career with YOU, where I believe I can further deepen my knowledge and accelerate my professional growth. It would be an honor to contribute to your esteemed team.
